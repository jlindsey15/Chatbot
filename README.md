A limited and very unpolished experiment with natural language processing.  Here's a transcript of a back-and-forth that illusrates some of the program's capabilities and limitations.  You can see I have to phrase some questions awkwardly for it to work (e.g. "Does the cow be red?" instead of "Is the cow red?"), and the computer's responses are often even more awkward.  Still, there are some bright spots.
